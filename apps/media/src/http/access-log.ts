/**
 * The request log: one DEBUG record per response with its method, status, time taken, and path.
 * Effect's own request logger writes every response at INFO with the full path, so anyone who can
 * reach the port, with or without a token, could fill the retained log and rotate its history out.
 * At DEBUG nothing a caller sends is kept unless `LOG_LEVEL=debug` asks for it. The path loses its
 * query string, which carries playback tokens, and is cut to 128 characters. A handler that died
 * still logs at ERROR with its cause: that is a bug in the service, not traffic.
