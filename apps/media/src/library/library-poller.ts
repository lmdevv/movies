/**
 * Change detection for folders that send no file events: NFS, SMB/CIFS, 9p, and FUSE mounts such
 * as sshfs report changes made on the server or another client to nobody. A snapshot holds each
 * folder's modification time and subfolders; a folder's time changes when an entry is added,
 * removed, or renamed in it. Polling costs one `stat` per folder, and reads a folder again only
 * when its time moved. A file rewritten in place keeps its folder's time; the periodic
 * reconciliation scan catches that.
