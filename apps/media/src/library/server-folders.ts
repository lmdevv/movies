/**
 * The media host's folders inside the approved library roots (`LIBRARY_ROOTS`), one level at a
 * time, for choosing a library's folder (`libraries.folders`). Paths come back as the caller wrote
 * them, joined with each folder's name, so a library keeps the path its owner chose rather than
 * where a link resolves. Only folders that can be opened in turn are listed: a link leading out of
 * the roots is left out. A folder outside the roots (as written or as it resolves), gone,
 * unreadable, or written with `.` or `..` answers `NotFound` alike, so the listing never tells
 * what exists outside them. Plain files cost nothing; only links are followed.
