/**
 * Reads the retained log for a query: the last `limit` matching records, newest file first so a
 * recent question never reads the whole history, then, when following, each new matching line as
 * it is written. Files outside the query's time window are skipped by their names and modification
 * times; a modification time counts as up to two seconds early, since network shares and FAT keep
 * it that coarsely. Each line is redacted again before it is decoded or matched, so a file written by anything
 * else never shows, and a `grep` never finds, what the console would hide.
