/**
 * `POST /api/logs`: the retained log for admins, as NDJSON. The body is a `LogQuery`, and the
 * caller's Convex auth token must hold the `admin` scope. Without `follow` the answer ends after
 * the last matching record; with it, new matching records stream until the caller disconnects,
 * and a blank line every 15 seconds keeps idle proxies from closing the connection. A follow ends
 * as the service begins to shut down, so an open one never holds the shutdown up. While the log
 * folder cannot be written or read, the answer says since when (`LOG_UNAVAILABLE_SINCE_HEADER`).
 *
 * NDJSON over a plain chunked response rather than server-sent events: it is the files' own
 * format, so the CLI passes lines through untouched, and `fetch` sends the bearer token, which a
 * browser's `EventSource` cannot.
