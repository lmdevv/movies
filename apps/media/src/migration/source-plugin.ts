/**
 * The typed contract every migration-source plugin implements (plugin role `migration-source`).
 * A plugin reads one Jellyfin or Plex server, read-only: it sends only GET requests, plus the one
 * sign-in POST a password login needs, and never touches media files. Its manifest lists the one
 * host it may reach (the server the admin named); `guardSourceHost` enforces that list and the
 * allowed methods on the HTTP client the plugin is given.
 *
 * Plugins translate their server's data into the source-neutral records below, so matching,
 * planning, and importing never see Jellyfin or Plex shapes.
