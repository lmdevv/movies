/**
 * Sealing source credentials for a stored migration plan. A migration job must survive a media
 * service restart, so its plan (in Convex) carries the source credentials, sealed with AES-256-GCM
 * under a key derived (HKDF-SHA256) from `MEDIA_SERVICE_API_KEY`. Convex stores only that key's
 * hash, so neither Convex, its dashboard, nor a backup archive can open the credentials; rotating
 * the key makes stored plans unreadable, and their jobs fail asking for a new import.
 *
 * Connections themselves (connect, dry run) keep credentials in memory only, for an hour.
 * The plan's server ID and URL are bound in as associated data, so a sealed value cannot be moved
 * to another plan.
