/**
 * Join watching with two browsers: the owner hosts and an invited member follows with a stream of
 * their own. A late guest lands on the live position; the host's pause and seek reach the guest;
 * the guest's controls are locked and the server refuses their commands; the host's stall holds
 * the guest; a guest who stalls catches up without moving the host; host and guest browse away
 * and come back through the navbar's room pill, also after the room moved to another film, and
 * the pill shows only on the device and profile in the room; the host going away pauses the room;
 * room links say why they cannot be joined; and an ended room takes the pill away. The film remuxes to HLS, so the suite
 * can hold segment requests to stall a player. Settled drift goes to the test's annotations.
