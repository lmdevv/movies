/**
 * One movie or episode playing in one `<video>` element: the imperative shell of web playback.
 *
 * It starts a playback session, asks where to start when there is saved progress, negotiates a
 * stream with this browser's capabilities, attaches it, and reports progress through the SDK
 * until disposed (which ends the session). Failures follow `playback-policy`: a replaced HLS
 * generation reloads its playlist, a lost stream or an expired token renegotiates, a path the
 * browser cannot decode is dropped and the next one tried, and a missing file stops with its own
 * state. Tokens are renewed by renegotiating five minutes before they expire, so a six-hour token
 * never ends a long film. Audio tracks switch by renegotiating with the chosen track, and so do the
 * quality cap and picture subtitles (PGS, VobSub), which the media service burns into the video;
 * text subtitles are `<track>` elements and switch without a new stream. Another version (file) of
 * the movie or episode plays in a new session from the same position, keeping the audio and text
 * subtitle languages where the new file has them. A subtitle delay (`subtitle-timing`) moves the
 * text subtitles' cues for this playback only: another track or version starts at zero again.
 * While it reports progress it also reports what the player saw (`diagnostics`): stalls, dropped
 * frames, each stream attached, stream failures, hls.js segment loads, and every recovery.
 *
 * Every SDK call runs on the app's SDK runtime and comes back as a value; nothing here throws.
