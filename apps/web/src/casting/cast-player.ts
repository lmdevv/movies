/**
 * The SDK's `PlayerPort` over a Chromecast: positions and state come from the Cast SDK's mirror of

 * seek goes through `move`, which knows whether the receiver can seek by itself (a direct file) or
 * needs the stream moved first (HLS); until it lands, the player reports the target and counts as
 * buffering, as the element player does. Receivers play at normal speed only (`fixedRate`), so
 * the room engine corrects drift by seeking.
