# [movies]

MIT-licensed, agent-first, self-hosted movie and TV platform. It streams the user's own folders or
NAS shares with reactive playback, shared watching, and full Jellyfin and Plex migration. The
product name is `[movies]`, brackets included; the repo and packages use `movies`.

- Plan: [Linear project](https://linear.app/adsfsd/project/movies-b7a377940443). It holds the
  overview, stack, architecture, and design summary.
- MVP: media service, web app, SDK, and CLI with an agent skill. Native mobile and TV apps are V1.

## Rules

- **Copyleft code is read-only.** Jellyfin (GPL-2.0), Silo (AGPL-3.0), Kyoo (GPL-3.0), Wholphin
  (GPL) and Streamyfin (MPL-2.0) may be read for ideas and edge cases. Never copy, port, or
  translate their code into this repo. SyncLounge and stremio-core are MIT and may be reused with
  attribution. Effect, T3 Code and OpenCode are MIT and safe to reference.
- **Load the `coding-standards` skill** before writing, reviewing, or refactoring TypeScript. It is
  in `.agents/skills/coding-standards/`, copied from `dmmulroy/.dotfiles` at `574e1f2`; Dillon has
  since removed it, so don't `skills update` it. Where any skill conflicts with this file, this file
  wins: no lint suppressions or disabled rules, even where a skill shows them.
- **Effect 4 reference.** `effect` is pinned in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Keep a read-only clone of
  the matching `Effect-TS/effect-smol` tag in `.repos/effect-smol` (gitignored) and read its
  `LLMS.md` before writing Effect code. Do not import from or edit it.
- **Convex functions stay plain TypeScript** with `v` validators. Effect lives in the media
  service, contracts, SDK, and CLI.
- **No MCP server.** Agents use the CLI and `apps/cli/skills/movies/SKILL.md`.
- **Never commit secret values.** `.env.example` lists configuration names only.
- **Never weaken a lint rule, add a cast, or add a suppression to pass checks.** Fix the code or
  report the finding. Casts other than `as const` need a `// SAFETY:` comment.
- **No module mocks.** Test through real seams.

| Path                 | Role                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`           | Vite + React + TanStack Router SPA                                |
| `apps/media`         | Node + Effect HttpApi media service; serves the built SPA         |
| `apps/cli`           | Effect CLI with JSON output; agent skill in `skills/movies/`      |
| `apps/mobile`        | Expo + Expo Router + Uniwind iOS app over `@movies/sdk/react`     |
| `packages/backend`   | Convex schema, functions, and Convex Auth                         |
| `packages/contracts` | Effect Schema DTOs, errors, media HttpApi, plugin role interfaces |
| `packages/sdk`       | Effect core with `/effect`, `/react`, `/promise` entry points     |
| `packages/ui`        | shadcn components restyled through Paper tokens                   |
| `packages/config`    | Shared strict `tsconfig`                                          |
| `deploy/compose`     | Docker Compose: Convex backend plus media/web                     |
| `nix/`               | NixOS module                                                      |

Ownership: Convex owns accounts, profiles, grants, libraries, titles, files, jobs, watch history,
and playback sessions. Disk owns original media, which is read-only. The media service owns
per-device streams, ffmpeg processes, and temporary segments. Convex never calls the media
service; the media service signs in with a restricted credential and subscribes outward.

The SDK core has no Node filesystem or DOM imports. Media and backend modules must never reach
browser bundles.

## Commands

```sh
nix develop          # Node 24, pnpm, ffmpeg
scripts/dev-stack.sh up  # isolated Convex backend for this worktree
pnpm install         # also patches tsc and Oxlint with Effect diagnostics, installs lefthook
pnpm dev             # web on :3001 and Convex dev
pnpm typecheck       # tsc 7 with the Effect language service
pnpm lint            # Oxlint, type-aware, anti-slop and Effect rules
pnpm fmt:check       # Oxfmt
pnpm test            # Vitest
pnpm test:e2e        # Playwright
pnpm knip            # unused files, exports, and dependencies
scripts/check-deploy.sh  # installs pin one Convex backend and expose every media setting
```

`typecheck`, `lint`, `fmt:check`, `test`, `knip`, and `scripts/check-deploy.sh` run in the lefthook
pre-commit hook and in CI. All must pass before every commit. A new media service setting goes in
`deploy/compose` (entrypoint, `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`), the root `.env.example`,
`nix/module.nix`, and both READMEs; `check-deploy.sh` names what is missing.

Each worktree gets its own stack: `scripts/dev-stack.sh up` starts a self-hosted Convex backend in
Docker, deploys the functions, configures auth keys, the playback token secret and the media
service credential, and writes the `.env.local` files. Ports, the data volume, and the temporary
output directory derive from the worktree name; `scripts/dev-stack.sh env` prints them, and
`down` / `destroy` stop or remove the stack. Commit the regenerated `convex/_generated/`.

The Effect reference lives in `.repos/effect-smol`. Effect 4 stable releases are tagged in
`Effect-TS/effect`, so clone the tag matching the pinned version:
`git clone --depth 1 --branch effect@4.0.3 https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect .repos/effect-smol`.

## Contributing

### Commit messages

Use this structure for commit messages and PR titles:

```text
type(scope): summary
```

- Use `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `migrate`, `update`, `perf`, `build`, or `ci`
  for the type. Name the affected package or domain in the scope, such as `media`, `web`, or `sdk`.
- Write the summary in imperative present tense, lowercase, with no trailing period. Describe the
  concrete change, such as `fix(media): stop streams when playback ends`.
- Add an optional bullet body for substantial changes or notable impact. Explain why the change
  is needed, the resulting behavior, and any important risk, migration, or follow-up.
- Base the message on the staged diff. Replace vague messages such as `fix stuff` or `address
  review` with the actual change.
- Put relevant PR and issue references in a `Refs:` trailer, such as `Refs: #19, ADS-145`.
  Place it after any bullet body and before co-author trailers. Use known references only,
  deduplicate them, and omit the trailer when none apply. Preserve relevant references when
  rewording, rebasing, squashing, or merging commits.
- Every agent-created or agent-amended commit must include `Co-authored-by` trailers identifying
  the contributing model and coding tool. Read the actual identities from runtime context or
  configuration. Never silently omit attribution because a trailer was not supplied by the harness.
- Use `noreply@openai.com` for OpenAI models and Codex, and `noreply@anthropic.com` for Anthropic
  models and Claude Code. For other providers or tools, resolve their attribution address before
  committing. Do not invent model identities or addresses, and do not include thinking-level metadata.
- Deduplicate trailers and verify that attribution is present before every commit or amend.
  Preserve all contributing agents' trailers through rebases, squashes, and merges.

Example:

```text
docs(agents): define commit and pull request writing rules

- define commit titles and optional bodies so history explains each change.
- require PR descriptions and merge messages to match the final diff.

Co-authored-by: openai/gpt-6.1-sol <noreply@openai.com>
Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>
```

The example identities must be replaced with the model and tool that actually contributed.

### PR descriptions, rebases, and merges

- Write the PR description for a reviewer who has not read the conversation. Lead with the
  problem and resulting behavior. Include relevant validation results and material risks or
  migration steps. Keep simple changes to a short paragraph and validation notes.
- After scope changes or a rebase, and immediately before merging, compare the PR title and
  description with the final diff against the target branch. Rewrite stale or vague text, remove
  abandoned approaches, and update validation results. Report skipped or failing checks accurately.
- During a rebase, review the messages of commits that will remain in history. Reword vague or
  outdated messages and combine fixup commits where appropriate. Preserve valid co-author trailers.
- Before a squash or merge commit, explicitly review and improve its title and body using the
  same rules. Use the final PR title and description as the starting point, then remove review
  chatter and redundant commit lists. For a rebase merge, check each retained commit message.
- These writing checks supplement the verification and review requirements below.

## Verify and review

- Ports come from the worktree's stack: Convex API at base, auth at base + 1, media at base + 2, web
  at base + 3. `scripts/dev-stack.sh env` prints them. Playwright uses `E2E_PORT`, else the stack's
  web port, else 3011.
- Stack suites need Docker and `scripts/dev-stack.sh up`: `pnpm --filter <pkg> test:stack` for
  `@movies/backend`, `@movies/sdk`, `@lmdevv/movies`, and `@movies/media`, then
  `pnpm --filter web exec playwright test`. For the migration suites, pull the pinned image
  (`docker pull` the `jellyfin/jellyfin:12.2@sha256:…` reference in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  and set `MOVIES_JELLYFIN_DOCKER=1`; without the image the media suite skips the real-Jellyfin
  case silently, but the web migration spec starts Jellyfin anyway, pulling the image or failing.
- Repeat runs: `pnpm --filter web exec playwright test --repeat-each=20`, `pnpm test --repeats=20`.
- Project skills in `.agents/skills/`, pinned in `skills-lock.json`: `react-doctor`,
  `react-best-practices`, and `diagnosing-bugs`. They're all model-invoked.
- `scripts/stack-e2e.sh` builds the image and smoke-tests the packaged stack;
  `scripts/nixos-module-e2e.sh` does the same for the NixOS module on a NixOS host, and
  `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.vm -L` boots the module in a NixOS VM (needs KVM).
- CI runs `check`, both stack jobs, and the Nix job. PRs matching the `paths` in
  `.github/workflows/image.yml` also run its `build and smoke-test`. `main` has no branch
  protection, so check every one yourself before merging. Never merge with admin bypass.
- Every PR gets Codex automatic review on GitHub; address its findings before merging. Run
  Claude's `/code-review` locally before you open or merge one. Do not enable, request, or wait for
  CodeRabbit or Bugbot.
- Cloud environments: none yet. Pin the Claude one in `.claude/settings.json`
  (`remote.defaultEnvironmentId`) and write the Codex ID here for `codex cloud exec --env`. Docker
  suites run in Claude cloud only.

## Design

Build UI from the Paper file `[movies]` (ID `01M4PMRM5T60Q4P0YYZ8DY580D`) through the Paper MCP.
Paper Desktop must be running.

- Paper is the source of truth. Read structure with `get_tree_summary` and `get_jsx`, exact values
  with `get_computed_styles`, and the target with `get_screenshot`. Never read colors or sizes from
  screenshots.
- Tokens live in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` under their Paper names. Re-export them with
  `get_tokens` in `tailwind` format when the design changes. Dark is the default theme and maps
  each `--color-dark-*` token onto its light role inside `.dark`.
- Use tokens for every color, size, and font. No raw values in components.
- Netflix look on web, the Apple TV app look on iOS, Netflix red in both modes.
- Content rules: no tips or filler copy, no CLI hints in the UI, no colored left stripes, and
  whitespace over bordered cards. One "Search ⌘K" field opens the command menu.
- Follow the design handoff note in the owner's vault (`projects/movies/movies Design.md`): flows,
  artboard map, decisions, and open questions. If code must differ from Paper, flag it instead of
  drifting.

## Pstack skills

Poteto's pstack is the Claude Code plugin `pstack@cursor-plugins`, enabled at project scope in
`.claude/settings.json`. Its commands take the `pstack:` prefix, such as `/pstack:poteto-mode`.
Do not copy its skills into `.agents/skills/`. Invoke `/pstack:poteto-mode` explicitly for a
substantial task; do not apply the whole workflow to every small edit or casual question.

Model choices live in `.agents/pstack-models.md`, not `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` or
`~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`. `/pstack:setup-pstack` writes there, and every pstack role
reads its line there.

This file takes precedence over pstack. Keep `coding-standards`, required `// SAFETY:` comments,
Codex automatic PR review, and Claude's local `/code-review`; do not request Bugbot or CodeRabbit.

<!-- BEGIN:turborepo-agent-rules -->

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
