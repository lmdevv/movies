# Demo library

`ghcr.io/lmdevv/movies-demo-library:v1` is the full set of `scripts/demo-library.sh` as a
data-only image, so a server can show every feature without your own films and without a
download script. It holds about 7 GB, in one layer per title (and per Pioneer One episode):

Every title has a Kodi-style NFO, so it matches without a TMDB key, and local artwork. The image
also holds `CREDITS.md`; the credits are below.

## Use it with Docker Compose

`deploy/compose/compose.demo.yaml` mounts the image read-only at `/media/library` in place of
`MOVIES_LIBRARY` (Docker 28 or later). Docker pulls it once per machine, and every container that
mounts it shares that copy. From `deploy/compose`:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.demo.yaml up -d
```

Open the web app, create the owner account, and add `/media/library/Movies` as a movies library
and `/media/library/Shows` as a shows library. With plain `docker run`, the same mount is
`--mount type=image,source=ghcr.io/lmdevv/movies-demo-library:v1,target=/media/library`.

## Build it

`scripts/build-demo-library.sh` downloads the full set into a temporary folder and builds the
image, or builds from a finished download with `--from ~/movies-demo` (run
`scripts/demo-library.sh --set full --dir ~/movies-demo` first). It checks that the folder holds
every title, complete with the Feature Test's image subtitle, since the Dockerfile copies titles by
name. The Demo library workflow publishes the version named in `deploy/demo-library/image` for
amd64 and arm64 when it changes on main. A published version never changes: to change what goes
in, bump the version there and in `deploy/compose/compose.demo.yaml` (`scripts/check-deploy.sh`
checks that they match).
